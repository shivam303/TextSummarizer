Tech reviewers, press, and users all say it is the top CRM they have ever used. Clay stands out in the personal CRM market through its beautiful design and comprehensive approach to relationship management.

Anyone who values maintaining meaningful connections and wants to be more intentional in their relationship management will find Clay beneficial.\\n\\n…\\n\\nClay offers several unique features that set it apart from competitors.

Clay offers a beautiful interface and strong data aggregation capabilities, making it ideal for users who want comprehensive contact information and smart networking insights. Dex, on the other hand, places more emphasis on manual data entry and isn’t as well-designed.\\nClay isn\\'t designed to replace enterprise CRM systems for large sales teams, but it can be a powerful alternative for individuals and small teams. Many people use Clay instead of Salesforce, Hubspot, and Pipedrive. Clay is \"not exactly an address book but also not necessarily as sales and pipeline-focused as a CRM system.\" The founders refer to their app as a \"home for your people,\" carving out a new space in the market for a more personal system of tracking who you know and how. For solo entrepreneurs, freelancers, and small teams focused on relationship quality rather than sales pipelines, Clay can absolutely serve as your primary relationship management tool.\\nClay is uniquely designed to bridge both professional and personal relationship management. Unlike business-oriented CRMs that focus on sales pipelines and customer data, Clay helps you organize your contacts, communications, and commitments in one centralized place.

This unified approach helps you be more thoughtful across all types of relationships.\\nClay\\'s robust integration capabilities help position it as the top contact management solution.

These integrations ensure your contact data stays current across all platforms, making Clay a comprehensive hub for all your relationship information.\\nClay\\'s AI capabilities are at the forefront of personal CRM innovation. Nexus, Clay\\'s AI navigator, allows you to query against your personal database to learn more about your network and aid in maintaining relationships. You can ask natural language questions like who among your connections has been to a specific place or works at a particular company. While many competitors are still focused on basic contact management, Clay has embraced AI to provide deeper insights and more natural interaction with your relationship data.\\nUser feedback consistently highlights Clay\\'s elegant design and powerful features. Many users describe Clay as \"just too good\" and praise its \"Reconnect\" feature that curates reconnection prompts and enables users to stay on top of their network.

I have a love for all aspects of **technology** and **applied problem solving** and currently work in Mountain View, CA.\\n\\nAs a full stack software engineer I like to bring together a wide variety of software development experience in order to bring refined, functional, and scalable products to life. I have had the opportunity to hone my skills while working at large corporations (LinkedIn, VMware, Thermo Fisher, Draper) and startups (Earnest).\\nWhen I'm not at my computer, I'm probably taking pictures, watching movies, at the gym, or traveling the world.\\n\\nWorking on the Pages team in Mountain View, CA.\\nI worked within LinkedIn Sales Solutions on the rearchitecture and redesign of the Sales Navigator product using the Pemberly technical stack. During my time on this project I developed patterns for a synchronized cache layer leveraging Ember Data, significantly reducing redundant API calls, and allowing for instantaneous optimistic client-side updates. I was also able to boost route transition and render performance by 2-4x (worst case) and 10-20x (best case) and introduce viewport based lazy load and render occlusion culling to our web application.\\nI rearchitected key portions of the NSX Manager web application in Angular 2+ using redux patterns with a centralized service layer.\\nAdditionally as a part of my work I developed the following: a coexistence platform to ease JS framework transitioning (moving from ExtJS to Angular 2+) with selective app switching and capabilities for inter-app communication using RxJS, various reusable Angular components, a new workflows feature to enable eased guidance through the various complexities in the NSX platform, role based access controls of features using route guards, and a real time, isometric network topology diagramming tool with interactive and editable capabilities using Node.js and vis.js.\\nI developed a Feature Flag and A/B Testing Platform designed to aid in unified or partial rollouts of new features to certain audiences with the ability to measure their success through a singular micro-service. The RESTful API was created using a hapi.js server layer, a PostreSQL database, and a custom module to track A/B statistics via Optimizely; this was paired with an administrative front end written in React with Okta authentication for privileged tasks. Additionally, I worked to develop various other UI components for the loan applications using Angular 1.x.\\nI worked on creating, revising, and maintaining webpages featured on the Rady School of Management website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XSLT, and Velocity. Additionally I contributed to full redesign of the Rady website using Bootstrap and lead the efforts for increasing site speed performance following the changes (compressing static assets, decreasing JS dependencies, etc.).\\nI developed an internal tool to gather and aggregate data in real time in ASP.NET, with an Oracle database, Visual Basic back end, and an HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. This tool to allowed for teams to track their overall progress while taking on tasks through a series of easy to read metric visualizations. I also created scripts to aid in workflow automation by pulling desired information from multiple different sources and formatting it into desired reports to be used by project managers.\\nI worked as an Engineering Intern in Draper Laboratory's Inertial Instrument Test and Development group. I developed algorithms and MATLAB scripts to aid in the collection and analysis of data from accelerometers and gyroscopes used in the Trident II Mark 6 Mod 1 guidance system program for the Navy. My work on a new accelerometer data-processing algorithm was implemented at a production facility that is managed by a Draper vendor while other work was used onsite.\\nI was the VP of Engineering of Lumnus Consulting during my senior year at UCSD. In this position I worked to develop partnerships with startup incubators and accelerators in the San Diego and LA area to acquire and source clients, lead a team of developers and designers working on projects, and individually contribute to projects as well. During my time as VP of Engineering we worked on several projects building out web applications and static marketing websites.\\nI was the Vice President of the UCSD chapter of Project RISHI where my role was to help oversee and delegate tasks amongst our board, and ensure that we thrive as an organization. Previous to my time as Vice President I was the webmaster and in my role I dealt with all technical aspects of the organization and led the development of the new UCSD Project RISHI website.\\nI was the Technical Team Lead for TESC where I provided technical solutions for our organization as well as the over 20 member organizations that fall under our purview. In my role, I lead development of our new website and associated sites, handled technical questions, and operated a 15 person development team dedicated to innovating in event creation, checkin, and analytics.\\nI was the technical chair of SangamSD at UCSD for two years. In my role I dealt with all technical aspects of the organization and lead the development of the SangamSD website. Other projects were focused on event registration, management, and payment solutions through our website.\\n\\nI was the president of the UCSD International and Out of State Student Organization and in my role oversaw the creation and execution of multiple events and was able to effectively delegate tasks amongst my team. This organization was dedicated to creating a more welcoming environment on campus for international and out of state students through community building activities.\\nAs a part of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers I worked with the president of the organization to help in the planning and execution of several professional events held on campus as well as the West Regional Conference that saw almost 200 attendees from all across the west coast as well as professionals from companies in the San Diego area.\", title='Shivam Sharma | Staff Software Engineer at LinkedIn', url='https://shivam.info', date=None, last_updated='2025-11-08'), Result(snippet='#### Suggestions\\n\\n# Shivam Sharma\\n\\n## Student at Pune Institute of Computer Technology\\n\\nShivam Sharma is a\\n\\n**Staff Software Engineer** at LinkedIn, specifically working on the **Pages team**.
